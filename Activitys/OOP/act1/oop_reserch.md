Abstraction

It is a process of hiding unnecessary information from the user.


Inheritance

It is a way of representing real-world relationships. Example car, bus, bike are all vehicles. This means they have inherited the properties of class vehicle and all are used for transportation.


Encapsulation

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data.


Polymorphism

Polymorphism with Inheritance
Polymorphism in python defines methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class. In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class. Also, it is possible to modify a method in a child class that it has inherited from the parent class.
