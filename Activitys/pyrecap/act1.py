#Create variable that holds the text "welcome to Code Nation"
welcome = "welcome to Code Nation"
print(welcome)

#Find the length of the string and save this to a new variable
print(len(welcome))
num = (len(welcome))
# print(welcome)

#Create a function that checks if the string length is even


#if it is, print the string, the length and an 
# appropriate message in one sentence.


#Do the same but with a different message if it's odd.



#Change the string length so you can test all possible outcomes
