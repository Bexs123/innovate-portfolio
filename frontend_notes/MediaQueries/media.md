Media queries is an amazing tool for responsive websites.

All we have to do is tell CSS what rules to apply depending on the screen size being used.

Mobile screens are portrait and desktop is landscape.

Orientation - Portrait - Landscape

You can have multiple media queries if you need them. Styling might develop in complexity once you consider all the aspects of accessibility on different screens.

Absolute vs relative values
px(absolute)  the same  on all screens
em, %, rem, vh, vw(relative) different depending on screen size.
Relative values are preferred when using media queries as they are relative  to the screen or element, they can scale themselves up or down.

vw and vh - Virtual width and Virtual height
Viewport measurement units are calculated as a percentage of the screen size.

You can change what content is shown depending on your screen size, you may want to show/hide things on different devices.
