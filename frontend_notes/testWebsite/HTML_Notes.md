HTML

Hyper Text Markup Language it is used for coding the actual content of webpages. Its been around since the early 90s and continues to be hugely important part of web development.

It is described as the structure of a webpage. It is the most basic building block of the web.

HTML on it own without the use of CSS and Javascript looks really horrible and there is no way of the user being able to interact with the page, this is where both CSS and JavaScript comes into making the website better. CSS is the design and JavaScript makes things on the website more user interactive.

HTML is constructed with lots of elements.

The HTML element is made up of the tagname some content and closing tagname.

Tags

When a HTML document is read, it is the element tags which determine the type of content displayed.

Some basic elements
<p> elements represents a paragraph

<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5> & <h6> elements respresents heading. <h1> is the biggest heading and can only be used once on the page, however you can use as many as the other as you like on the page.

<img> element represent images

The alt attribute and why we use it?

It is a text description of the image, and it is displayed on the web page if the image can't be loaded or is broken.
Also it is very useful for accessibility as screen readers will read this description to the user so they know what the image is.

Links
<a> element represents links
target="_blank" tells the browser where to display the linked url also it will open the link in a new tab - all external links must have this attribute as it allows the user to remain on your web page too, without the target="_blank" you will stop users from coming back to your page
